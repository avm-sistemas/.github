## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have here some of my applications.

At [my personal github](https://github.com/avmesquita), I will maintain studies and tests.

At this repositories, I will maintain stable software, some in development stage and some archived.

Did you like any of them?

Do you think any of these solutions could be your path?

If you need help with software development, call me.
